	Welcome to the Java programming language and Java How to Program, Tenth Edition! This
	book presents leading-edge computing technologies for students, instructors and software
	developers. It’s appropriate for introductory academic and professional course sequences
	based on the curriculum recommendations of the ACM and the IEEE, and for AP Com-
	puter Science exam preparation. If you haven’t already done so, please read the back cover
	and inside back cover—these concisely capture the essence of the book. In this Preface we
	provide more detail.
	We focus on software engineering best practices. At the heart of the book is the Deitel
	signature “live-code approach”—rather than using code snippets, we present concepts in the
	context of complete working programs that run on recent versions of Windows®, OS X®
	and Linux®. Each complete code example is accompanied by live sample executions.
